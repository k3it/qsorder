v2.8
 - uninterrupted recording mode (with the -C or "--continuous" flag), parrallel to recording of individual QSOs
   hourly audio files are saved in the AUDIO_YEAR directory, a new mp3 file is created at the top of each hour.
   Extra Disk space required for this option: ~360 MB per 24 hours
 - increased sampling rate from 8000 to 11025
 - pyaduio library updated to version 0.2.8 https://people.csail.mit.edu/hubert/pyaudio/

v2.6b
input selection options, debug option, skip old qsos
	- new flags -q, -i, -D to allow sound input selection and the debug log.
	- skip udp packets for old QSO, for example ignore QSO edits

v2.5b
 - fixes for N1MM integration issues. Play Contact now works for phone contests 
 - SO2R Mode (--so2r flag).  Connect Left Radio to Left audio channel, Right Radio to the Right channel.  
     In this mode QSORDER will downmix the "active" audio input to MP3 mono, and mute the "inactive" radio input. 
     In other words - Radio 1 QSOs will be recorded from the Left Ch, Radio 2 QSOs - from the Right Ch.
     without this flag both Left and Right channels are saved to a stereo file.
     HOT KEY - always saves in stereo
 - yet another change of the default global hot-key (to CTRL-ALT-O)
 - see BUGS.txt for known issues with qsorder

v2.2b
added UDP --port and --station-nr options for Multi-Multi setups
